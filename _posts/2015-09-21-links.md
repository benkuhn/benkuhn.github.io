- 80,000 Hours asks [nonprofit leaders](https://80000hours.org/2015/09/what-do-leaders-of-effective-non-profits-say-about-working-in-non-profits-interviews-with-givedirectly-deworm-the-world-initiative-development-media-international-schistosomiasis-control-initiativ/) about their jobs.

- Chris Olah [outlines](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-09-NN-Types-FP/) a cool potential correspondence between neural networks and functional programming.

- Scott Alexander [gets back into political theorizing](http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/09/11/book-review-manufacturing-consent/) with a review of *Manufacturing Consent*. "Was I disappointed that the authors didn’t develop their original point about the media more? I was at first. Then I realized this was the book about obscure brutal Third World military conflicts that I’d never known I needed."

- Someone else [hated on ORMs](http://seldo.com/weblog/2011/08/11/orm_is_an_antipattern) better than [I did](http://scraps.benkuhn.net/2015/09/09/orm.html).

- Stephen Diehl [lists all the things](http://dev.stephendiehl.com/hask/) he wishes he knew when learning Haskell. Skimming highly recommended as this is *long*! My favorite parts were the list of things to avoid in Prelude, the entire section on promotion and higher kinded types; a couple parts of the section on tools; Template Haskell and lenses.
