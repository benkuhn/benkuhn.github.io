title: Two interesting GiveWell updates
---

I just got back from their most recent [research event](http://www.givewell.org/research-discussions). One of the most interesting new takeaways for me was the work that GiveWell is doing to develop new top charities starting earlier in the pipeline:

1. They've begun a partnership with IDInsight, an organization that runs cheaper but still rigorous randomized evaluations of development interventions. GiveWell is [providing funding](http://www.givewell.org/IDinsight-grant) for IDInsight to evaluate a program of providing incentives to immunize children.

2. They're providing some startup grants to organizations that they think might have the potential to become new top charities. Elie gave [New Incentives](http://www.newincentives.org/new-incentives-receives-major-grant-19032014/) as a particular example. New Incentives provides cash transfers to HIV-positive expecting mothers when the mothers comply with the medications that prevent their child from developing HIV. NI has a combination of a founder that GiveWell found to be very trustworthy and competent, and an intervention (conditional cash transfers) with robust support in the literature, so Good Ventures made them a large start-up(ish) grant.

3. They've also looked into funding the creation of new evidence for interventions that don't currently have it. For instance, Good Ventures made [a grant to Evidence Action](http://www.goodventures.org/our-portfolio/grants/evidence-action-planning-for-future-programs-march-2014) to do more exploratory research into conditional cash transfers in Bangladesh to incentivize farmers to emigrate to the city and send money home during the fallow season on the farm.

Somehow I managed to miss these developments when they first came up in my GiveWell feeds, so it was good to be reminded of them at the event!
