The Chicago Booth School's [Initiative on Global Markets](http://www.igmchicago.org/igm-economic-experts-panel) takes opinion polls of economists on various policy questions, like [school vouchers](http://www.igmchicago.org/igm-economic-experts-panel/poll-results?SurveyID=SV_en84EM2wwWJOLWs) or [the gold standard](http://www.igmchicago.org/igm-economic-experts-panel/poll-results?SurveyID=SV_cw1nNUYOXSAKwrq). Be sure to (a) read the economists' comments, since sometimes people interpret the questions differently; and (b) try not to update too much on Daron Acemoglu's views just because he's alphabetically the first economist.

David Roodman (now working for GiveWell/Open Philanthropy Project) has an interesting post on [mounting evidence that moderate drinking *isn't* good for you](http://davidroodman.com/blog/2015/05/01/are-the-benefits-of-moderate-drinking-a-myth/). Essentially, the "moderate alcohol is good for you" studies were all observational, so they had a hard time dealing with causal identification (e.g., it could be that *ceteris paribus* healthier people drink more). Meanwhile, cheap genome sequencing now means that we can do cool instrumental-variables type analyses, which tend to show negative effects from drinking even at low levels. (Interesting discussion in the comments about how valid the Mendelian instrumentation actually is.)

Charity Science [randomizes some of their fundraisers](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eP7WZMA7GddpL9yVRNFztwVBKODMVJpIhWVQw1QI97A/edit) to receive matching funds or seed funding. (Relevant to [my donation matching lit review](http://www.benkuhn.net/matching).) It'll be interesting to see more detailed analysis of their results!
