title: "Bleg: programmers, what tools and practices have improved your work the most?"

Post your suggestions in the comments!

Backstory: I realized recently that I had pretty much stopped consciously trying to spend time getting better at my job. Which is pretty silly since I'm still probably in the bottom 5% of programming experience--I clearly have a ways to go!

I'm trying a bunch of different projects to tackle this from different angles, and one of them is improving the tools I use. I've noticed in the past that some tools, or practices, have had a surprisingly large effect on the speed with which I can code or the number of bugs I make. (I've started the comments off with an example.)

Unfortunately, it's hard to know what these will be before making the sometimes-substantial investments to learn them. So I'd love to know other folks' thoughts here!
