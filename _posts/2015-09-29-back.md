I decided having two blogs wasn't actually accomplishing my goal of having an outlet for lower-quality writing, because people kept submitting the lower-quality stuff to Hacker News too. Also, none of the lower-quality stuff ever turned into higher-quality posts on the main site. So my new plan is to stop worrying about quality at all and post everything to the main [benkuhn.net](http://www.benkuhn.net/) site. This site will probably no longer update. I may re-post some of the good articles here to the main site, like I intended to forever ago.
