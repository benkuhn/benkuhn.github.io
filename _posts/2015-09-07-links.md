- [100,000 Hours](http://worldoptimization.tumblr.com/post/126848111674/100000-hours-introduction) is a new effective altruist organization:

    > It’s a common misconception that we recommend all EAs “marry to give,” or marry a high-net-worth individual with the intent of redirecting much of their wealth to effective causes. In retrospect, we emphasized this idea too much in our early days, and as the most controversial of our suggestions it attracted a lot of press. In fact, we recommend that only a small fraction of EAs pursue MtG. MtG is probably best suited to attractive people, those with good social skills, those who fit in well in high-status and wealthy circles, and women looking to marry men–hardly a large percentage of the EA community. And if you do think that MtG is a good fit for you, we recommend that you still marry someone you like. Marrying someone you dislike is likely to lead to burnout and unhappiness, which will make you less effective in your other goals.

- Dan Luu [read a ton of software failure postmortems](http://danluu.com/postmortem-lessons/) and is here to tell you what not to do. (*Test your error handling,* guys.)

- Someone finally took a crack at making an [abstract syntax tree editor](https://www.facebook.com/notes/kent-beck/prune-a-code-editor-that-is-not-a-text-editor/1012061842160013) for code. (Unfortunately it has the minimally marketable name of Prune...)

- Just about every time I try to write a Bash script, it screws up because of some weird Bash corner case. (Filenames starting with dashes? Word splitting?) Fortunately there are some good resources on [how not](http://redsymbol.net/articles/unofficial-bash-strict-mode/) to [screw up](http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashPitfalls) your Bash scripts. (Of course, the best way is just to write Julia and use [backticks](http://julia.readthedocs.org/en/latest/manual/running-external-programs/), but that's not always practical...)
