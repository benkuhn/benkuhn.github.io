So my perfectionism totally got to me and now I don't want to put
low-quality posts on [my real website](http://www.benkuhn.net/). But I
still want to write them because I think
[it's helpful to me](http://www.benkuhn.net/writing-clarify-thoughts).
So I'm going to put them here instead and try to go for volume rather
than quality, in the hope that this leads to more of both in the long
run.
