So my perfectionism totally got to me and now I don't want to put
low-quality posts on [my real website](http://www.benkuhn.net/). But I
still want to write them because I think
[it's helpful to me](http://www.benkuhn.net/writing-clarify-thoughts).
So I'm going to put them here instead and try to go for volume rather
than quality, in the hope that this leads to more of both in the long
run.

I'm also experimenting with Facebook's comment box (I'm using a static
site generator, so I can't have my own comments like my main site
does). Let me know what you think of it. If you want to comment
anonymously, you can email me and I'll post it for you.
