title: Learning J
---

I recently decided it had been too long since I taught myself a random obscure programming language. (Something like five years, in fact. Yikes!) So I started to pick up [J](http://www.jsoftware.com/). J is a descendant of [APL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APL_(programming_language)), which is known mostly for being typed with the world's craziest character set:

APL uses those characters for one- and two-letter mnemonics of every array manipulation primitive (and higher-order function of array manipulation primitives) you could ever want, and then about 10x more. J is like APL that you can write without a custom keyboard.

What does J do differently from your garden-variety functional language? The most interesting thing is probably how functions work. Most programming languages use the standard functional syntax: prefix notation with comma-separated arguments. J, by contrast, has *only* unary prefix operators and binary *infix* operators, and function notation is more linguistically structured (even going so far as to call the functions *verbs*).

This isn't as nice as prefix-paren notation for complicated architecture-astronautics, but it makes up for it by allowing concise primitives for function combination (like [forks](http://www.jsoftware.com/jwiki/Vocabulary/fork
) and [hooks](http://www.jsoftware.com/jwiki/Vocabulary/hook)) that would be impossible to parse in other languages. For instance, you can define an average function as `average =: +/ % #`--to be read as "the average is the running sum divided by the length." This uses a *fork* (`_ ? _` where the left and right verbs are unary and the middle is binary) and an *adverb* (`/`, the equivalent of "fold" or "reduce") to write in one line (and [tacitly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacit_programming)) what could take three or four in a less-expressive language.

You can write `average` in one line in something like Python (`lambda x: sum(x) / len(x)`), but you can't do that with some of the more complex things people do in J. [Rosetta Code](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Rosetta_Code) is a great place to find examples of this; the most classic one is Conway's Game of Life in one line:

```
life=: (_3 _3 (+/ e. 3+0,4&{)@,;._3 ])@(0,0,~0,.0,.~])
```

It's certainly harder to parse than the same thing in e.g. Python, but it's kind of fun to try and figure out how everything works!
