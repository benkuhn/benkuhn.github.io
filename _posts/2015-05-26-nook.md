title: Cheap tablets as e-readers
---

A while ago I decided that I wanted a cheap e-reader that could display PDFs reasonably. That meant most e-ink displays were out (most screens were too small, and the larger ones were too expensive). Instead, I looked through the various cheap tablets that were available. Most had pretty low resolutions, but the [Nook HD+](http://www.amazon.com/Barnes-Noble-Touchscreen-Tablet-Browser/dp/B00O0G4F3I/?tag=s4charity-20) stood out as a potential solution since it had much better specs than any comparable tablets (probably it's a loss leader for Barnes and Noble).

I've now owned mine for a few months. After trying a bunch of different syncing solutions and readers, I've mostly settled on [PDF Reader](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pdf.reader)/[Moon+](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.flyersoft.moonreader) for reading and [Calibre](http://calibre-ebook.com/)/[Calibre Companion](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.multipie.calibreandroid&hl=en) library management.

Thoughts:

- It's reskinned with a highly crappy UI for no apparent reason. This makes common tasks (like changing which apps appear on the home screen) unreasonably difficult to someone used to standard Android.

- Either the crappy UI is also un-optimized, or the Nook processor is really bad, but various drawing operations aren't smooth at all.

- I think this poor user experience causes me to read noticeably less than I would if I had a nicer reader (e.g. a Kindle), though I'm not sure.

- Syncing ebooks between PC and Nook is non-trivial. I've been using Calibre's wireless sync feature because OS X hates Android by default, but the wireless sync took a fair amount of fiddling to set up (specifically I think the Nook failed to auto-discover the sync server and I had to manually enter the IP).

- I was expecting annotation to be easier on the Nook than on a Kindle (since it has a better keyboard and more responsive UI), but it's not enough to cause me to actually use annotation. Then again, I was never a big annotator of paper books either.

- Overall, I'm not sure this setup is better than a Kindle + reading textbooks on my computer.
